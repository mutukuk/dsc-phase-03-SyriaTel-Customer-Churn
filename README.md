## 📊 Business Understanding  

### 🔍 Problem Statement  
Customer retention is more cost-effective than acquiring new users. High churn rates impact revenue, making it essential to:  

- **Predict churn (Yes/No) using machine learning.**  
- **Identify key factors contributing to churn.**  
- **Provide actionable insights to enhance customer retention.**

## 📂 Data Understanding  

### 🔹 Dataset Overview  
The dataset consists of **3,333 customer records** with **21 attributes**, including:

- **Demographics:** State, area code  
- **Usage Metrics:** Call minutes (day/evening/night), charges  
- **Service Attributes:** International plan, voice mail plan, customer service calls  
- **Target Variable:** Churn (Yes/No)  

---

## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering  

- **Missing Values:** No missing values found.  
- **Feature Selection:** Dropped irrelevant columns (e.g., phone number).  
- **Categorical Encoding:** Converted categorical variables into numerical (0/1).  
- **Outlier Treatment:** Used **IQR method** to cap extreme values.  
- **Scaling:** Standardized numerical features for optimal model performance.  

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

### Key Findings:  
- Customers with **more than 4 customer service calls** are highly likely to churn.  
- Users with an **international plan** exhibit a **higher churn rate**.  
- Higher **daytime call minutes usage** correlates with **lower churn risk**.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models & Performance  

### 🏆 Models Implemented  
- **Logistic Regression** (Baseline)  
- **Decision Tree Classifier**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
- **Hyperparameter Tuned Models** (Decision Tree & Random Forest)  

### Model Performance  

| Model                | Accuracy | AUC-ROC Score |
|----------------------|---------|--------------|
| Logistic Regression | 85.9%   | 0.60         |
| Decision Tree       | 90.6%   | 0.79         |
| Random Forest       | 92.9%   | 0.80         |
| **Tuned Decision Tree** | **93.1%** | **0.83** |
| Tuned Random Forest | 92.9%   | 0.80         |

📌 **The Tuned Decision Tree model performed the best**, balancing **accuracy** and **interpretability**.
